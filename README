To build the game, run
 qmake
 make
in this directory. Qt >= 4.7 with Declarative enabled is required.

Alternatively, you can run the game in qmlviewer directly:
 qmlviewer main.qml

For instructions on how to play, press F1 on the game opening screen. Have fun!

We also have nice sound effects, but somehow nobody has the QtMultimedia module (including us)
which is required for playing sound from pure QML applications. Thus, they're disabled
in this version.
